# Project Context

## Quick Summary
- Project name: Fullbox (internal fulfillment/WMS portal).
- Goal: manage SKU, orders/receiving, tasks, audits, role-based cabinets, and label printing.
- Current status: Django 6.0 app in production; latest updates on 2026-01-04 (placement act UI changes, favicon, template tweaks).

## Current Focus
- Last recorded focus: placement act UI in склад (pallet contents in table, SKU column, box extraction rule).
- Why it matters: clarifies warehouse placement workflow for storekeepers.

## Recent Decisions
- Decision: Django 6.0 + Python 3.12; default SQLite with optional PostgreSQL via env.
- Reason: lightweight local setup with production-ready DB option.
- Date: see `journal.md`.
- Decision: always deploy changes to server after edits (and restart service when needed).
- Reason: keep production in sync with local fixes.
- Date: 2026-01-04.

## Open Questions
- Question: confirm scope/ownership of Oracle APEX + FastAPI integration (see `note.txt`).
- Owner: project lead.

## TODO (short list)
- [ ] Capture current sprint goals / next tasks.
- [ ] Verify pending deployments or migrations.
- [ ] After reboot: confirm if busy cursor persists on desktop; if yes, check Task Manager/Explorer; if no, check browser extensions.

## How to Run / Test
- Setup: `python -m venv .venv`, `.venv\\Scripts\\activate`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run: `python fullbox/manage.py migrate`, `python fullbox/manage.py runserver`.
- Tests: not documented.

## Key Files / Folders
- `README.md` - overview, routes, env vars.
- `description.md` - stack, modules, local run details.
- `journal.md` - detailed change log.
- `fullbox/` - Django apps and project code.
- `DEPLOY.md` - deployment steps.
- `LABEL_PRINT.md` - label printing spec.
- `server_access.md` - server access details (sensitive).
- `.env.example` - env vars reference.
- `Начальные таблицы/` - source XLSX data for `load_initial_tables`.
- `fullbox/db.sqlite3` - local SQLite DB (default).

## Notes for AI Assistant
- Preferred language: Russian (based on chat).
- Style constraints: concise, CLI-friendly; ask only when needed.
- Anything to avoid: do not paste credentials; refer to `server_access.md` and `note.txt` for secrets.
- This file is my memory aid; I must log each of my actions here.
- Always deploy changes to the server after edits.

## Restart Notes
- After reboot: check if busy cursor appears on desktop (not just browser).
- If yes: open Task Manager → sort by CPU/Disk; restart `Windows Explorer`.
- If no: test in incognito or disable extensions; share pending requests if any.

## AI Action Log

- 2026-01-09 10:14: keep in-box inputs empty unless user types manually; scan only updates box counts.
- 2026-01-09 10:07: show active box qty in the in-box input when no manual value and clear only the scanned row's manual input.
- 2026-01-09 10:01: focus scanned row using pending element after render to prevent cursor staying in the previous in-box input.

- 2026-01-09 09:06: add idle-based scan detection to receiving flow so barcodes are captured even without Enter and restore focused input values.
- 2026-01-09 09:00: improved receiving flow scanner capture to work regardless of focus and add scanned SKU from client catalog when missing in the table, with clear status messages.
- 2026-01-09 08:47: remove client-confirmed response tasks after manager views the act print page and close manager receiving tasks so confirmed orders move to done.
